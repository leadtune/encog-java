/**
 * An interface designed to abstract classes that store machine learning data.
 * This interface is designed to provide EngineDataSet objects. These can be
 * used to train neural networks using both supervised and unsupervised
 * training.
 * 
 * Some implementations of this interface are memory based. That is they store
 * the entire contents of the dataset in memory.
 * 
 * Other implementations of this interface are not memory based. These
 * implementations read in data as it is needed. This allows very large datasets
 * to be used. Typically the add methods are not supported on non-memory based
 * datasets.
