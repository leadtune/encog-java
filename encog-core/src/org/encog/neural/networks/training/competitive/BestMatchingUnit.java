 * The "Best Matching Unit" or BMU is a very important concept in the training
 * for a SOM. The BMU is the output neuron that has weight connections to the
 * input neurons that most closely match the current input vector. This neuron
 * (and its "neighborhood") are the neurons that will receive training.
 * 
 * This class also tracks the worst distance (of all BMU's). This gives some
 * indication of how well the network is trained, and thus becomes the "error"
 * of the entire network.
